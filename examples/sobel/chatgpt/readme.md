Prompts in order:
* can you provide a 3 by 3 configurable kernel for grayscale video in vhdl?
* can you better pipeline this for better fmax?
* can you modify the VHDL to use any NxN kernal?
* can you add a pipelined sum tree?
* can you make the number of pipeline stages dynamic-based on the kernel size?
* can you replace the multiplication with shifts based on each bit of kernel?
