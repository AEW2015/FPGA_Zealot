What is FPGA?

A Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) is a device with configurable hardware that is defined by the user, YOU!
Design digital hardware is very different than software.
Software takes a very sequential path to solve a problem.
Hardware on the other hands is concernt can solve the problem at once.

Where do I get one?

How do program it?

What should I use it for?

Project Ideas:
* 	Bang detector
* 	Bit mine
* 	Small BNN
* 	Video
* 	Processor Dev
* 	Emulator
* 	Graphics card for soft processor (3d shpaes)
* 	cryptographic processor
* 	Ray tracer
* 	Mandelbrot Generator
* 	PID controller, quadcopter?
* 	Oscope
* 	IOT encription
* 	SDR
