This project will explore the basic features of the Digilent Arty Dev Board.
This board has a series 7 Xilinx SRAM-based Artix FPGA.
The main features to demo (without additional hardware):
* 	DDR
* 	UART
* 	LEDs
* 	Buttons/Switches
* 	Ethernet

This will include a tcl to build the project (aim for Vivado 2020 when it comes out).
